On-air hand doodle system is a new way of authentication method.  This is one of new technology where many applications can include for
there authentication purpose. We used HTML, CSS to develop the login, Register, and Profile web pages in order to carry out this first. 
Additionally, backend processing has been incorporated into the Python code and is utilised for voice recognition, drawing, saving,
erasing, and other functions. The Django database connection platform integrates the front end and back end processing.
We built the tables for searching and retrieving within Django. The example mp3 recording is stored locally for speech recognition, and 
the path needs to be changed during execution of code,have to be included in python code.
Install Python >= 3.0.1 first, which should support a connection to Django version is 3.6.0, before starting the execution. After 
installing Python, lauch a Jupyter notebook in it and use pip to install the libraries as pyaudio, mediapipe, opencv, django, etc.
Once the libraries have been installed, start the code that will run the voice recognition and on-air hand doodle authentication. At 
last the process will run at localhost.
